    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>The two canvases above represent two visualizations of the same data. The first is the classic Game of Life, seeded randomly. The second visualizes the "force" of life (or death) over time.</p>

    <p>At each step, the presence of a live cell brightens the corresponding pixel, while a dead cell darkens it. Over time this results in an image depicting where life has been able to flourish.</p>
